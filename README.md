# World HappinessReport Dashboard
## Introduction
Welcome to the World Happiness Report Dashboard. The The World Happiness Report is a publication of the Sustainable Development Solutions Network, powered by data from the Gallup World Poll. The report is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness that ranks 156 countries by how happy their citizens perceive themselves to be. The data used is from the survey results from 2015 to 2020. The variables for each survey is GDP per capita, life expectancy, social support, freedom to make choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption.

This online dashboard takes away the industrious process of users analysing surveys to create statistics and assists the user in analysing the surveys with computer code and display graphs. Think of it as your own virtual assistant for analysing datasets and producing statistics.

Also, I am not a data scientist so if my works like that of an amauter I apologise. I am a software developer with an interest in data science.
